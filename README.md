This project is a fork of [this project](https://github.com/dhennessy/BatteryCapacityTester), see also [this blog post](http://denishennessy.com/2012/04/08/measuring-battery-capacity-with-an-arduino/)

I plan to edit the project to measure 2 18650 batteries with an arduino and few resistors. Results will be uploaded via serial port to pc
